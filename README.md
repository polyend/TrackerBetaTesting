# Polyend Tracker Beta Testing

![Polyend Tracker Product Image](./images/product-image.jpg)

This repository exists to enable community members to help testing
beta versions of the [Polyend Tracker](https://polyend.com/tracker/)
firmware.

## The rules are simple

* **Check for duplicates** before submitting your report or idea.
  We might get a little grumpy if you don't.  First time on GitHub?
  No worries, the Search bar is right on the [Issues](https://github.com/polyend/TrackerIssues/issues)
  page.  Just try a few queries for what you're looking for.

* **Always** refer to the particular firmware version you're currently
  using.  This is crucial for us to determine if the problem is still
  there or whether it's been already fixed.  To save yourself the
  trouble,
  [look here for the latest published firmware](https://polyend.com/downloads/).
  Your issue might already be addressed!  If you're interested in testing
  beta firmware, read [HOWTO_BETA_FIRMWARE.md](./HOWTO_BETA_FIRMWARE.md).

* **A clear English description** makes it easier for us to understand you.
  Please don't ignore the provided template!
  
* **A word about feature requests.** Where possible, Polyend will fix any firmware-related issues considered bugs. 
Polyend is always keen on hearing user feedback about possible functionality improvements, 
however, we are not obligated to implement such feature requests. 
Please respect that while we appreciate our customersâ€™ opinions and wishes, we cannot guarantee or promise to implement them.

  Also, please bear in mind, that as every other product, Polyend Tracker was made with some initial hardware and software assumptions.
It's hardware resources have own limitations, thus not every "simple" (from your perspective as a user) addition and feature request
is simple or even possible to implement in reality. Thank you for your understanding.

## Attachments

Provide as many **attachments** as possible with your report.
We're especially looking for:

* direct links to videos where you show the bug;

* pictures (you can drag them into the edit box when submitting your
  bug report);

* zipped projects from the SD card.
