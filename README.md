# Polyend Tracker Beta Testing moves to Polyend Backstage


We have decided to move the Polyend Github as we will be migrating bug reporting, feature requests, support, and all other communication to our new official Backstage forum. If you want to join these efforts please sign up at [backstage.polyend.com](https://backstage.polyend.com). The forum should allow us to focus our efforts in one place and respond more efficiently to you.

Thank you to everyone that participated on GitHub. We plan to be active and responsive on the official forum and hope that it will enable us to connect with the community more easily and be a central hub for all things Polyend.

What’s next?

## About Bugs

In the following weeks we will log the most critical bugs from Github into our internal tools for tracking and close them here. After migration some bugs might slip through the cracks. So if you still experience an issue which you logged here, with the latest released firmware, please help us and remind us about it in Backstage. It has a Bug category to track issues for all our products in [released firmware versions](https://polyend.com/downloads/) (for beta, see below).

## About Enhancements

On the other hand, most reports here are feature requests which will not be migrated. Instead we decided to refocus and turn the page: the new forum provides a Wishlist category which allows users to vote for the features they deem most important. We hope this simple but powerful tool will help us determine what the community values as most important and for us to communicate if these features are feasible or not. High votes don’t guarantee a wish will be implemented. But if you have a feature request please draft a wish on the forum and we’ll definitely consider it.

##Future of Beta

Finally, for those of you that own Play and would like to contribute to testing beta releases, we invite you to join the beta program on Backstage. We are kicking off with Play and if it proves to be successful, more products (including Tracker) will follow soon…

Once again thanks for your support and patience. We hope the new forum will serve us better to make our products shine, so you can have more fun making music!
